# Time Progress Tracker

A Flutter Application to create Timers with a percentage indicator.
The Idea for this Application came to me while, I was doing my civil service.
It is a really simple app at this state. You can enter Time Progresses, which are made up of
a name, a start date, and a end date.
Then you can see a list of all currently active and a list of all currently inactive progresses,
including their current percentages.

## Current State of the repo.

Currently, the code in this branch is pretty messed up. Since I wrote that application from a
prototype which, was developed as my first flutter project and in a very short time.
Since, then most of the work that went into this project was cleanup work.

Currently I am working on a clean codebase in the feature/platform-widget branch.

At this state, the base screens of the app are located in lib/screens,
all other ui widgets are located in li/widgets,
the model classes are located in lib/model,
files related to persisting the data are in lib/persistence,
and redux related files are spread over lib/actions lib/middleware lib/reducers and lib/reducers.
